# fullbody-tracking-system
The purpose of this project is to create an open source version of body trackers based on Sony's Mocopi trackers.

Begins based on a RaspberryPi Zero 2w as main controller and server host of the web application to be used as interface, and a GY-87 10DoF MPU6050, HMC5883L, BMP180 Sensor module. 

This allows me to measure a three-axis gyroscope for angular speed, triaxial accelerometer, three-axis magnetic field for absolute orientation and atmospheric pressure to enhance the measurement of vertical postion, integrated with the accelerometer.
